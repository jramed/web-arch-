The bootstrap template has been downloaded from <a href="https://bootstrapious.com/p/universal-business-e-commerce-template" title="bootstrapious universal-business-e-commerce-template">
bootstrapious universal-business-e-commerce-template</a>

For the main page I have used the template [customer-orders](src/main/resources/static/customer-orders.html). The template has been simplified, by removing the not implemented parts.

For the order detail I have used the template [shop-basket](src/main/resources/static/shop-basket.html)

For just showing the order an example is [customer-order](src/main/resources/static/customer-order.html)
